Data

What is data?
information

limitations of file system to store data
1. there is no structure to store data
2. possibility of redundent data
3. no uniqueness of data
4. managing data, processing data is difficult
5. no security, no access control
6. can not have distributed access

Database
Data stored in structured manner on computer system
Can be handled easily

DBMS
Database Management System helps to perform CRUD operations on the data from database
C - Create
R - Retrieve
U - Update
D - Delete

Open MySQL console
type command to create new database
	create database <DATABASE NAME>;
	create database newdb;

command to check existing databases :
		show databases;

Need to connect to required database
			connect <DATABASE NAME>;
			use <DATABASE NAME>;
			Connect newdb;
			
			
Create table in database			
create table persons(
	personId INT,
	FirstName VARCHAR(40),
	LastName VARCHAR(40),
	Address VARCHAR(60),
	City VARCHAR(15)
);		

To check the tabkes in database
	show tables;

Add a record in the table : Insert command
Use insert command to add the record
	insert command adds a new record in the table
	INSERT INTO <TABLE NAME> VALUES(VALUE1, VALUE2, VALUE3,....);


insert into persons values(1,"Ramlal","Sharma","123 ABC Apartments","Delhi");
insert into persons values(2,"Shamlal","Verrma","123 XYZ Apartments","Delhi");

Insert multiple records at once
	insert into persons values
		(4,"Ramlal","Sharma","123 ABC Apartments","Delhi",34),
		(5,"Shamlal","Verrma","123 XYZ Apartments","Delhi",45)
	;

Insert data for specific columns 
	insert into persons(personId, FirstName, LastName) values(6,"Geeta","Bachchan");
	
	insert into persons(personId, FirstName, LastName) values(6,"Geeta","Bachchan"),(7,"Reeta", "Arora");


VARCHAR & Date data must be specified in double inverted comma. 

Fetch data from table
	SELECT * FROM <TABLE NAME>;

Alter command :	
Add column to existing table
		ALTER TABLE <TABLE NAME> ADD <COLUMN NAME> <DATA TYPE>;
		alter table persons add age INT;
Remove column from existing table
		ALTER TABLE <TABLE NAME> DROP <COLUMN NAME>;
		alter table persons drop Citizen;

Update command is used to modify existing records
			UPDATE <TABLE NAME> SET <COLUMN NAME>=VALUE,....;
			update persons set age=25 where personId=1;

Delete record

delete all records from a table 
	delete from <TABLE NAME>;
	
delete specific record from a table
	delete from <TABLE NAME> where CONDITION;


Primary Key :
	1. a single or combination fields
	2. identifies records in a table uniquely
	3. cannot be null or empty
Rules :
	1. key column must be unique
	2. each table will have only one primary key
	3. can not be null or empty 
	4. duplicate entries with existing primary key value is not allowed
	5. recommended to use INT or BIGINT data types as primary key column

create table employees(
	emp_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	emp_name VARCHAR(30),
	emp_designation VARCHAR(30)
);

insert into employees values
	(101, "Radha", "Developer"),
	(102, "Sham", "Developer"),
	(103, "Radha", "Tester"),
	(104, "Sham", "Manager")
;

Foreign key :
	a key that is used to link one or more tables together
	it is also called as referencing key
	
	creates a parent child relationship in 2 tables
	the parent table holds the initial column value and column values of child table will refer the parent table key

	can be createsd 
		1. create table
		2. alter table

[CONSTRAINT constraint_name]  
    FOREIGN KEY [foreign_key_name] (col_name, ...)  
    REFERENCES parent_tbl_name (col_name,...)  
	
	
Parent Table :
create table employees(
	emp_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	emp_name VARCHAR(30),
	emp_designation VARCHAR(30)
);

Child table
create table emp_info(
	emp_id_fk INT,
	emp_address varchar(40),
	emp_contact varchar(40),
	constraint fk_employees FOREIGN KEY (emp_id_fk)
	REFERENCES employees(emp_Id)
);


insert into emp_info values(
	101,"ABC Apart","1234567890"
);
insert into emp_info values(
	101,"PQR Apart","0234567890"
);

create a table customers with primary key as user id. This holds the information for all users of Amazon.
create another table as order_info which refers to primary key of customers

Clauses :
	1. where 
		can be used with select insert update and delete
		specifies the condition that must be fulfilled for selected records
		
		Specifiying 1 condition
		select * from employees where emp_id=101;

	AND operator for combining multiple conditions
		select * from employees where
		emp_name="Radha"
		AND
		emp_designation="Tester"
		;

	OR operator
	select * from employees where
		emp_name="Radha"
		OR
		emp_designation="Tester"
		;

	order by clause
		while we are retriving the data using select query
		if we want the records to sort in ascending or descending order
		 *order does not reflect in original data in the table*
		
		Select expressions
		from tablename
		where condition
		order by expression 

	group by clause
		used to collect data from multiple records & group the result by one or more column
		generally used with select query
		
		select * from table where
		condition(s)
		group by expression1, expression2,....;

		count, sum, min, max, avg
		
		select emp_designation,count(emp_designation) 
		from employees 
		group by emp_designation;

		having clause 
		 used with group by clause
		 it always return the records where the condition is true
		 
		 select * from table where
		 condition(s)
		 group by expression1, expression2,....
		 having condition;
		 
Joins:
	joins are used in select query
	used to fetch the data from multiple tables
	
	types of joins
		1. Inner join (simple join)
		2. Left Outer Join ( Left Join)
		3. Right Outer join (right join)

1. Inner Join 
		used to return all rows from multiple tables where join condition is satisfied
			SELECT columns
			FROM table1
			INNER JOIN table2
			ON table1.column = table2.column;

	SELECT employees.emp_id,employees.emp_name,emp_info.emp_address
	FROM employees
	INNER JOIN emp_info
	ON employees.emp_id = emp_info.emp_id_fk;
+--------+----------+-------------+

+--------+----------+-------------+
|    101 | Radha    | ABC Apart   |
|    101 | Radha    | PQR Apart   |
+--------+----------+-------------+


2. Left join
	used to fetch records from multiple tables
	it retrieves all the records form 1st table even no matching records found in second table
	if no matches are found from right side table then returns null
	
	SELECT columns
	FROM table1
	LEFT JOIN table2
	ON condition;

	SELECT employees.emp_id, employees.emp_name
	FROM employees
	LEFT JOIN emp_info
	ON employees.emp_id = emp_info.emp_id_fk;
	 emp_Id | emp_name | emp_designation |

|    106 | Rekha    | Tester          |
+--------+----------+-----------------+
	
	
	
	
	SELECT employees.emp_id, employees.emp_name, emp_info.emp_contact
	FROM employees
	LEFT JOIN emp_info
	ON employees.emp_id = emp_info.emp_id_fk;

+--------+----------+-------------+

+--------+----------+-------------+


3. Right Join
	used to retrieve data from multiple tables
	returns all records from right table and those from left table where condition is satisfied
	if unmatched records in left table it returns null 


	Select columns
	from table 1
	right join table2
	on condition;

GIT installation

User configuration using git config command
git config --global user.name "USERNAME"

git config --global user.email "EMAIL ID"

git config --list : provides the configuration details

git init 
	very first command that we execute on system
	used to create a blank repository
	
git status 
		used to check the status of current repository
		
git add		
	git add <filename> adds one file to staging area
	is used to add file to repository
	it brings all files to staging area
	then these will be added to repository when commited
	to add multiple files to staging area 
	git add .

HTML
	Hyper Text Markup Language
	used to design static web pages
	how to represent the data
	files are with .html extension
	HTML has predefined tags (mark ups)
	Javascript engine available in each browser
	it interprets HTML tags and represents the data
	HTML is interpreted language
	HTML is not case sensitive
		<H1></h1>
		<BoDy></bOdY>
		This is allowed as no case sensitivity
		spaces in hTML are omitted

Tag
	script of HTML
	tags are with start tag <tag name> & end tag </tag name>
	types of tags	
		1. stand alone tags
				certain tags that dont have start and end tag
				<br/> <hr/>
		2. Pair or range tag
				<html></html>
				<body></body>

nested tags	
	when we have any tag inside another tag it is termed as nested tag
	
Heading Tags
		<H1> </H1>
		.
		.
		.
		.
		<h6></h6>
		predefined size & thickness of text
		every content will appear on next line

Lists are used to arrange the elements 
types of list	
	ordered list - ol
	unordered list - ul

Tags : predeifned have specific meaning interpreted by Javasccript engine

if we need additional parameters / properties to be applied to tags, we can make use of attributes
every tag has specific attributes
attributes are always specified in start tag

How to add attribute to a tag
<TAGNAME AttributeName="VALUE">

Adding images to html page
<img src="nature.jpeg" alt="Image of Nature" width="300" height="200">

img is the tag used to add image in HTML file
src is attribute to specify file or image path
alt is alternate text. displayed if image is not loaded in the browser
width & height in pixel for image


Links in HTML page
	used to navigate from one page to another
	it could be navigation to another html page or to external resource like any web page
	
	
	<a href="url" target="">Text</a>
	
	the tag used is <a>
	href specifies destination address stands for Hypertext reference
	url - address to navigate to
	Text - will be displayed on the web page for clicking
	target specifies the end location of refernced document to open
	_self -> the referenced document will open in same tab 
	_blank -> the referenced document will open in new tab

Tables in HTML
	helps to represent data in structured format
	data will be present in row & column format

	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Heading 1</th>
			<th>Heading 2</th>
			<th>Heading 3</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>data 1</td>
			<td>data 2</td>
			<td>data 3</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>data 1</td>
			<td>data 2</td>
			<td>data 3</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>data 1</td>
			<td>data 2</td>
			<td>data 3</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

Forms in HTML
	form is used to collect data from user
	form contains form elemnts as textbox, textfield, radio button
	checkbox
	button etc
	
	input type="text" - single line input field or textfield
	attributes:
		type : what type of input control - textfield, radio, checkbox
		name : used to give name to a control
		value : inital value in the control 
		maxlength : specifies maximum number of characters to be entered in the control

CSS
Casacading Styale Sheet
Used to design HTML tags


HTML Tag ---> Attributes 

limitations of attributes
    if multiple tags need to use same attribute value, must be specified independently
    and repeated for each tag
    use certain attributes for different tags

    <p>This is some content for <font> HTML</font></P>

it is style sheet language that is used to describe look & formatting of a document

syntax

selector{property : value}
selector{property1 : value1; property2 : value2};

h1 {color : red}
P {color : green; font-size : 10 px}
body 


selector : indicates the HTML element to which style should be applied
declaration block : holds one more more properties and their values to apply 
                    separated by semicolon

Selectors :
1. Element Selector :
    selects the HTML element with specified name
    the effect is applied to all the elements with the HTML tag name
    when to use ? when you want to apply same styling to all the elements in the HTML 
    document

2. ID selector  :
    selects the HTML element with specified ID
    when to use ? when the effect to be applied on an unique element

3. Class selector :
    selects multiple elements with specified class name
    when to use ? when you need to apply same style to different HTML elements which
    can not be identified with element name or id
		
4. Class selector for specific element :
    selects the element with combination of tag name and class attribute value
    when to use ? when multiple HTML elements have same class name however the
    style to be applied is different

5. Universal selector :
    the style is applied to all elements in HTML page.
    when to use ? when you want same style to be applied for all elements 
    in HTML document    

6. Group selector : 
    selects all the elements wth same style application
    when to use ? when you want to apply same style for different 
    HTML elemets    

how to add css?
    1. inline css
            used to apply css on a single line or HTML element
